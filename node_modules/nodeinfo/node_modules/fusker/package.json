  "readme": "**Fusker is an application firewall that prevents and manages a multitude of attacks in nodejs**\n\n![How it works](http://i.imgur.com/wkJdu.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install fusker, use [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):\n\n    $ npm install fusker\n\n## Example\n\nPlease see [the examples folder](http://github.com/wearefractal/fusker/blob/master/examples/) to get an idea of how to use Fusker properly\n\n## Test Site\n\nYou think you're one raw dog? [fusker.nodester.com](http://fusker.nodester.com/) Come at me bro.\n\n## HTTP Configuration\n### List of included HTTP detection modules (detectives)\n```\ncsrf - Detects cross-site request forgery in incoming http requests\nxss - Detects common XSS attacks in incoming http requests\nsqli - Detects SQLi attempts in incoming http requests\nlfi - Detects common LFI attacks in incoming http requests\n404 - Punishes people who like to snoop around. Only use with single page applications\n```\n\n### List of included HTTP payload modules\n```\nblacklist - Blacklists IP from HTTP server for specified amount of time (banLength in config)\nfake-report - Alerts attacker that they have been reported to ic3 and displays DOJ logo\nsaxroll - Redirects attacker to 1227.com\nnimp - Redirects attacker to fusker.on.nimp.org (WARNING: Harmful to attacker)\nnyan - Redirects attacker to nyan.cat\ngoatse - Redirects attacker to goatse.bz (WARNING: Harmful to eyes)\nbush - Redirects attacker to full screen George W.

Make sure fusker is the first piece of middleware added.\n\n### PROTIP BRO\nSetting config.silent to true will turn off all logging\nSetting config.verbose to true will turn on a ton of logging\n\n## LICENSE\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Fractal <contact@wearefractal.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
